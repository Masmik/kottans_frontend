# Kottans frontend course

 ## **Task 0**

It was a great opportunity to refresh knowledge and get experience with a pull request, its something new for me. 
Sometimes during the course, i thought - cool, i got it, but when i need to answer the questioning doubt crept in. Did I really get it?

About course How to use Git and GitHub materials, maybe because earlier i have some experience with git and GitHub, as for me a course was a little bit stretched.
But at the same time, the course program does not include a lot of important things such as git hist, git ignore, git reset or amend.


Anyway, I find it very helpful.


 ## **Task 1**
 
 
I'm a seasoned terminal fighter))). So the course Linux Command Line Basics was very familiar for me and I passed it repeating what I knew.
The courses Configuring Linux Web Servers and Networking for Web Developers forced me to start really thinking about it and revised the material several times to clearly understood.
I have seen a similar material in Bauman lecture of OSI model.

But the biggest challenge for me was working with RSA algorithm. I knew about cryptosystems from the Harvard course CS50. It was a challenge only because of my inattention. Instead of authorized_keys I created an authorized_key (without s in the end) file and spent a lot of hours to understand why my ssh keys didn't work. I investigated this problem, so it caused me repeat all the steps several times,  read and researched a lot of technical articles, comments on stack overflow. 

Maybe I spent less time to understand where I made mistake if I did not disable login via password and leave input through keys that did not work.

#### **Extra materials**

In the first article was written a plan for studying the Python. I think, the general idea of this article is that before starting studying you need to have a general plan that will already be adjusted in the process. It will help to see the progress and understand the way how to move on.

But the second article was really very sensible. Earlier I heard a few words about WebSockets and nothing about HTTP2/SSE, after reading I understood the main principles, differences between them. 

So this lesson really taught me a lot.


#### **TO DO**

- [ ] Try to create and establish WebSockets connection
- [ ] Try to install Linux, nginx, MySQL, PHP (LEMP) stack

 ## **Task 2**
 
The first course was very boring and was repeating the same thing from the task 0 several times. It's not cool, really.
But from the second course, I discovered a few new features, such as rebase, an option squash and the best practice of naming a point to the source repository - upstream.

#### **Extra materials**
