 #### **Impressions**

It was a great opportunity to refresh knowledge and get experience with a pull request, its something new for me. 
Sometimes during the course, i thought - cool, i got it, but when i need to answer the questioning doubt crept in. Did I really get it?

About course materials, maybe because earlier i have some experience with git and GitHub, as for me a course was a little bit stretched.
But at the same time, the course program does not include a lot of important things such as git hist, git ignore, git reset or amend.


Anyway, I find it very helpful.
