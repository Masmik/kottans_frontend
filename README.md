# Kottans frontend course

 ## **Task 0**

It was a great opportunity to refresh knowledge and get experience with a pull request, its something new for me. 
Sometimes during the course, i thought - cool, i got it, but when i need to answer the questioning doubt crept in. Did I really get it?

About course How to use Git and GitHub materials, maybe because earlier i have some experience with git and GitHub, as for me a course was a little bit stretched.
But at the same time, the course program does not include a lot of important things such as git hist, git ignore, git reset or amend.


Anyway, I find it very helpful.


 ## **Task 1**
 
 
I'm a seasoned terminal fighter))). So the course Linux Command Line Basics was very familiar for me and I passed it repeating what I knew.
The courses Configuring Linux Web Servers and Networking for Web Developers forced me to start really thinking about it and revised the material several times to clearly understood.
I have seen a similar material in Bauman lecture of OSI model.

But the biggest challenge for me was working with RSA algorithm. I knew about cryptosystems from the Harvard course CS50. It was a challenge only because of my inattention. Instead of authorized_keys I created an authorized_key (without s in the end) file and spent a lot of hours to understand why my ssh keys didn't work. I investigated this problem, so it caused me repeat all the steps several times,  read and researched a lot of technical articles, comments on stack overflow. 

Maybe I spent less time to understand where I made mistake if I did not disable login via password and leave input through keys that did not work.

So this lesson really taught me a lot.

 ## **Task 2**
 
The first course was very boring and was repeating the same thing from the task 0 several times. It's not cool, really.
But from the second course, I discovered a few new features, such as rebase, an option squash and the best practice of naming a point to the source repository - upstream.
   
1. What is Version Control

  ## **Task 3**
  
  Repetition is also a good idea
  New experience - find the way how to reinstall git prompt.

  ## **Task 4**
  
  I found out some new fitches from this course.
  The most useful for me was to practice in responsive patterns.
  Responsive Tables its also something new for me.
